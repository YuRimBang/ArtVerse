### Introduction
'ArtVerse' is a combination of "Art" and "Universe," aimed at supporting creativity and emotional development through doodling in an MR-based art activity program. Doodling is an essential activity for children to express emotions and develop creativity. This program, which can be easily accessed from home through HMDs, allows children to draw and undergo an AI-based art psychological evaluation to foster emotional stability and creativity. The goal is to reduce the financial burden of art education and enhance children's artistic sensitivity.
